            In order to keep a safe community, there are some guidelines which need to be followed by you<br>
            By using DISBOARD, you agree to the following guidelines:<br><br>

            The use of swear words, dirty words or NSFW (sexual content) to our discretion in a server's meta (title,<br>
            description and picture), review or other content that may be seen by other users in DISBOARD is not<br>
            allowed. This will lead to the removal of the content, however, you'll be able to repost the content with a<br>
            proper language.<br><Br>
            
            You may not violate any laws or regulations in your country of residence or promote the violation of them.<br><br>
            
            Servers violating <a class="discord" href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Discord Community Guidelines</a> are not allowed.<br><br>

            The use of bots or other scripts to automatically do actions in DISBOARD such as bumping a server ("auto-<br>
            bump") is not allowed. Bumping, creating reviews and etc. must be done manually.<br><br>

            You may not list servers which serve for the sole purpose of redirecting or advertising other servers or have<br>
            no content (To our discretion).<br><br>

            You may not reward or force users to do actions in DISBOARD. For instance, you may not reward your users<br>
            for posting a nice review on a server or force them to bump a server.<br><br>

            You may not create multiple Discord accounts to submit multiple reviews. Please just post 1 review per<br>
            person.<br><br>

            All servers which are mainly based on NSFW (sexual content to our discretion) must be marked as "NSFW"<br>
            in DISBOARD.<br><br>
